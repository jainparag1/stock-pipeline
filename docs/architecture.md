🏗️ System Architecture – Stock Market Streaming Platform
1. Overview

This document describes the end-to-end architecture of the Stock Market Streaming Platform, a real-time data pipeline designed to ingest, process, store, optimize, and analyze stock market events at scale.

The system follows modern lakehouse principles and separates concerns across:

Ingestion

Stream processing

Storage

Optimization

Analytics

Visualization

Orchestration

The architecture is intentionally modular to allow future migration to managed cloud services without redesign.

2. Design Principles

The platform was designed around the following principles:

🔹 Real-Time First

Streaming ingestion using Kafka

Low-latency processing via Spark Structured Streaming

Event-time aware processing

🔹 Storage as the Source of Truth

Immutable Parquet files

Append-only streaming writes

Optimized for reprocessing and backfills

🔹 Separation of Compute & Storage

Stateless Spark jobs

Object storage (MinIO) as durable layer

Independent scaling of components

🔹 Production Awareness

Checkpointing & fault tolerance

Compaction to solve small-file problem

Orchestration via Airflow

Analytics isolated from ingestion

4. Component Breakdown
4.1 Data Simulator

Purpose:
Simulates real-time stock market ticks.

Key Characteristics:

Generates random price and volume per ticker

Publishes JSON messages to Kafka

Designed to mimic real-world tick velocity

Why it exists:
Allows deterministic testing and local development without external data sources.

4.2 Kafka (Ingestion Layer)

Purpose:
Acts as the durable ingestion buffer between producers and consumers.

Responsibilities:

Decouples data producers from Spark consumers

Handles burst traffic

Guarantees message ordering per partition

Topics:

stock-ticks

4.3 Spark Structured Streaming (Processing Layer)

Purpose:
Processes real-time events and writes them to the data lake.

Responsibilities:

Schema validation

Timestamp parsing & event-time processing

Partitioned Parquet writes

Fault tolerance via checkpoints

Why Structured Streaming:
Provides exactly-once semantics and seamless transition between streaming and batch workloads.

4.4 Object Storage – MinIO (Lakehouse Layer)

Purpose:
Acts as the central, durable storage layer.

Characteristics:

S3-compatible API

Stores immutable Parquet files

Supports time-based partitioning

Partition Strategy:

year=YYYY/
  month=MM/
    day=DD/
      hour=HH/


This enables:

Efficient pruning

Time-based analytics

Scalable compaction

4.5 Compaction Job (Optimization Layer)

Problem Addressed:
Spark streaming creates many small Parquet files, which degrade query performance.

Solution:
A periodic Spark batch job that:

Reads a specific partition

Repartitions data

Writes fewer, larger Parquet files

Overwrites only the target partition

Execution:

Triggered via Airflow DAG

Runs independently of streaming job

4.6 Orchestration – Apache Airflow

Purpose:
Coordinates batch jobs and future workflows.

Current Usage:

Schedule compaction job every N minutes

Monitor job execution

Centralized operational control

Why Airflow:
Provides visibility, retries, and extensibility for future pipelines (DBT, quality checks).

4.7 Analytics Layer – dbt + DuckDB

Purpose:
Transforms raw Parquet data into analytics-ready datasets.

Responsibilities:

SQL-based transformations

Metric computation (min, max, avg)

Logical modeling of stock trends

Why DuckDB:

Lightweight

Columnar execution

Perfect for local and embedded analytics

4.8 Visualization – Streamlit

Purpose:
Provides real-time insights into processed data.

Features:

Live price trends per ticker

Aggregate statistics

Auto-refreshing UI

5. Failure Handling & Reliability

Spark checkpoints ensure recovery from failures

Kafka offsets tracked for ingestion consistency

Partition-level overwrite prevents global corruption

Batch compaction isolated from streaming jobs

6. Scalability & Future Enhancements

Replace MinIO with AWS S3 / GCS

Scale Kafka partitions

Deploy Spark on Kubernetes

Introduce Trino / Athena

Add data quality & schema evolution checks

7. Key Takeaways

This architecture demonstrates:

Production-grade streaming design

Lakehouse thinking

Clear separation of concerns

Operational maturity beyond toy projects

🧠 Architectural Mindset

“Good data systems aren’t defined by tools — they’re defined by boundaries, contracts, and trade-offs.”

This project intentionally mirrors how modern data platforms are built in high-performing engineering teams.
