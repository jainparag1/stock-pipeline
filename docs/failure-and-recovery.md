🔥 Failure Scenarios & Recovery Guide

Stock Market Streaming Platform

1. Kafka Producer Failure

Scenario

• The stock data simulator crashes or stops sending events.

Impact

• No new events published
• Downstream systems remain idle
• No data loss

Detection

• Kafka topic lag stops increasing
• Spark streaming shows zero input rows/sec

Recovery

• Restart producer
• Kafka retains previous data
• Spark resumes consumption automatically

Why This Is Safe

• Kafka decouples ingestion from processing, providing natural buffering.

2. Kafka Broker Restart / Offset Issues

Scenario

• Kafka broker restarts or topic offsets reset during development.

Impact

• Potential offset mismatch
• Spark streaming job may fail

Detection

• Spark logs show offset inconsistency
• Streaming query terminates

Recovery

• Restart Spark job
• Use failOnDataLoss=false (development only)
• In production, enable Kafka retention safeguards

Trade-off

• Prefers data availability during development over strict guarantees.

3. Spark Streaming Job Crash

Scenario

• Spark process crashes due to OOM, dependency issue, or node failure.

Impact

• Streaming pauses temporarily
• No data corruption

Detection

• Spark UI shows terminated query
• No new files written

Recovery

• Restart streaming job
• Spark resumes from last checkpoint
• Exactly-once semantics preserved

Key Mechanism

• Spark checkpoints store offsets and state.

4. MinIO / Object Storage Outage

Scenario

• MinIO service becomes unavailable.

Impact

• Streaming job fails on write
• Kafka continues accumulating data

Detection

• Spark write failures
• MinIO health checks fail

Recovery

• Restart MinIO
• Restart Spark streaming job
• Backlog processed automatically

Why This Works

• Storage is downstream of Kafka — ingestion continues safely.

5. Small File Explosion

Scenario

• High-frequency streaming produces thousands of tiny Parquet files.

Impact

• Query performance degradation
• Increased metadata overhead

Detection

• Excessive file count per partition
• Slower DuckDB/dbt queries

Recovery

• Trigger compaction job
• Overwrite only affected partitions
• Restore optimal file sizes

6. Compaction Job Failure

Scenario

• Compaction Spark job fails mid-run.

Impact

• Partition remains unoptimized
• No data loss

Detection

• Airflow DAG failure
• Partial overwrite prevented by Spark semantics

Recovery

• Rerun compaction DAG
• Idempotent by partition

7. Airflow Scheduler Down

Scenario

• Airflow scheduler crashes.

Impact

• No scheduled compactions
• Streaming unaffected

Detection

• DAGs not triggering
• Airflow UI unavailable

Recovery

• Restart scheduler
• Manual backfill if needed

8. dbt Model Failure

Scenario

• Schema mismatch or missing partition causes dbt failure.

Impact

• Analytics models not refreshed
• Raw data remains intact

Detection

• dbt run errors
• CI or logs show failing model

Recovery

• Fix model logic
• Re-run dbt
• No impact on upstream systems

9. Dashboard Failure

Scenario

• Streamlit dashboard crashes or loses connectivity.

Impact

• Visualization unavailable
• Data pipeline continues running

Detection

• UI inaccessible

Recovery

• Restart dashboard
• Stateless design enables fast recovery

🎯 Design Philosophy

This system is designed so that:

• Failures are isolated
• Recovery is predictable
• No single failure causes data loss
• Data pipelines should bend, not break.

📌 Key Takeaway

• Most failures are operational, not architectural.
• This platform is designed to fail safely and recover cleanly.
