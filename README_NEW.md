# 📈 Stock Market Streaming Platform

A production-style **real-time stock market streaming and analytics platform** built to demonstrate modern data engineering, streaming systems, and lakehouse design.

This project simulates high-frequency stock ticks, processes them using Spark Structured Streaming, stores them in an S3-compatible lakehouse (MinIO), orchestrates batch compaction via Airflow, models analytics using dbt + DuckDB, and visualizes trends in real time using Streamlit.

> 🧠 Built to showcase **streaming expertise**, **system design**, and **tech leadership mindset**.

## 🎯 Goals of This Project

- Demonstrate **end-to-end streaming system design**
- Showcase **production-grade Spark Structured Streaming**
- Implement **lakehouse patterns** (raw → compacted → analytics)
- Orchestrate batch jobs using **Airflow**
- Model analytics using **dbt**
- Visualize real-time insights with **Streamlit**
- Position the author for **Senior Engineer / Tech Lead / CTO** roles

## ⚙️ Core Components
### 🚀 Data Ingestion (Kafka)

- Simulated stock tick producer
- Durable event buffering
- Decouples producers and consumers

### 🔥 Stream Processing (Spark)

- Spark Structured Streaming
- Exactly-once semantics (checkpoint-based)
- Time-partitioned Parquet output

### 🪣 Storage (MinIO)

- S3-compatible object storage
- Raw + compacted datasets
- Partitioned by time

### 🧹 Compaction (Spark Batch)

- Solves the small-file problem
- Rewrites partitions efficiently
- Idempotent design
- Orchestrated by Airflow

### ⏱️ Orchestration (Airflow)

- Scheduled compaction jobs
- Partition-aware execution
- Failure retries & observability

### 📊 Analytics (dbt + DuckDB)

- SQL-based transformations
- Fast local analytics over Parquet
- Clean separation from ingestion layer

### 📈 Visualization (Streamlit)

- Live stock trends
- Min / Max / Avg price metrics
- Stateless, restart-friendly UI

### ▶️ Running the Platform (Local)

Please refer `docs/start-stop-services.md`

## 🛡️ Failure Handling & Recovery

This platform is intentionally designed to:

- Isolate failures
- Prevent data loss
- Enable predictable recovery

📄 See: docs/failure-and-recovery.md
---

### 🚧 Future Enhancements

- Schema Registry integration
- Delta Lake / Iceberg support
- End-to-end exactly-once guarantees
- Cloud deployment (AWS / AZURE/ GCP)
- CI/CD for Spark, Airflow, and dbt

### ⭐ Final Note

This project is intentionally designed to reflect **real-world production tradeoffs** rather than tutorial shortcuts.

If you are a **recruiter, hiring manager, or founder,** this repository demonstrates how I approach building, operating, and scaling modern data platforms.
